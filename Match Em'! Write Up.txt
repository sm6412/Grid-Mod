Match Em'!
By: Samira Mantri

Instructions:

Use the arrow keys to move up, down, left, and right. When you move in any direction your player will
swap with the tile in that space. In order to improve your grade, you must make matches according to an
animal's group. The five animal groups featured in my game are amphibians, mammals, reptiles, fish, and birds.
In order for the match to count, it must be a match of 3 tiles or higher. If the match contains animals of
the exact same species, those tiles will be worth double points. Once you run out of moves (indicated on
the player piece) the game will end and you will recieve your grade.

Evaluation of the Game’s Merit:

My goal was to create an educational game that really forces you to think in many dimensions. Though the
game can be initially difficult as you become familiar with the animal groups, you get better
as you learn to recognize the subtle differences between two similar animals. I think with regards to the
learning aspect of my game, it was successful. As for sound, I found that adding more sound effects in this 
game had a negative effect on the experience. At first, I wanted to add a sound effect everytime the player 
moved, but I found this to be annoying, especially when trying to concentrate. Therefore, I made sure to only 
add a sound effect when the player made a match, which turned out to be satisfying. The one aspect of my game I think 
it is lacking is more juice. I feel like I could have done more with the game if I had more time. Instead I 
spent my time focusing on the art and gathering information on all the animals so there is a fun fact at the 
end. Despite all this, I'm proud of my little animal game and I hope you enjoy it as much as I had fun making it!
